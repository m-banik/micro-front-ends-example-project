# Micro front-ends example project

## Description

An example project built in the micro frontends architecture provided by the Webpack in version 5. The author wrote the code while working with the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/microfrontend-course/) on Udemy.

## Instruction

The project consists of four smaller ones. Three of them, including the container, are written with React, and the last one, the dashboard, is made with Vue. Each of them is independent and as such is runnable and deployable in isolation. They are partially configured to be deployed. To run them in the development mode please follow the instructions below.

1. Navigate to given subdirectory.
2. Run command `npm start`.
3. To run the container app as operational, the other three must be already served (see the previous points).
